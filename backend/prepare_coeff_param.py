"""Placeholder module for applying BIGPOPA inputs to IFs working files.

This module will later move helper functions from ``model_setup.py`` to apply
parameter and coefficient values from ``bigpopa.model_input`` into
``RUNFILES/Working.run.db`` and ``Scenario/Working.sce`` as part of the ML loop.
Runtime behavior will be added in a future update.
